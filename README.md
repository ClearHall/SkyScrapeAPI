# SkyScrapeAPI

SkyMobile API is the API that was taken from the original SkyMobile app.

SkyMobile API allows easy Skyward access for developers. 

## Quick Start Guide

To start, you must have already included skyscrapeapi in your pubspec.yaml file.

Next, you must import the following.

```
    import 'package:skyscrapeapi/skywardAPICore.dart';
    //Optional
    import 'package:skyscrapeapi/skywardAPITypes.dart';
```
Importing SkywardAPITypes is optional, though it helps immensely with managing types and avoiding errors with your code.

Some of the most important methods you need to know are listed below.
- getSkywardAuthenticationCodes
- getGradeBookTerms
- getGradeBookGrades
- getAssignmentsFromGradeBox
- getAssignmentInfoFromAssignment
- getHistory

These are essential functions that will navigate through Skyward and return SkyScrapeAPI types.

An example of all this code would be located [here](https://github.com/skuweakyskies/SkyMobile). 

More information can be provided by the documentation generated by flutter.
